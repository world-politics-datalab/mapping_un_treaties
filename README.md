# Mapping the Ratification Status of International Treaties:

This repository includes many CSV files on the ratification status of treaties listed in the [United Nations Treaty Collection](https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ParticipationStatus.aspx?clang=_en). Students enrolled in various international relations courses at [Drew University](https://drew.edu/)collected and used these data to explore and analyze states' ratification of these instruments. The following table lists all the treaties analyzed and links to CSV files included in this depository and students' short analysis featured in the [World Politics Data Lab](https://worldpoliticsdatalab.org/).
